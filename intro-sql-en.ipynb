    "There are some more restrictions on the tables for the comparison to be relevant.\n",
    "Essentially, database tables only contain pure data, organized in **columns** or **fields**.\n",
    "One column represents a piece of information to store, and each **row** or **record** is an independent data entry.\n",
    "There is no notion of formatting (colors, empty lines, comment *etc*), no aggregate cells, no heterogeneous rows *etc*.\n",
